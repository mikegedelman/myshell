myshell - a very small/simple linux shell that leverages GNU readline

Supports the following operators:
   '>'  redirect stdout to file
   '2>' redirect stderr to file
   '&>' redirect stdout and stderr to file
   '<'  redirect stdin to process
   '|'  pipe output from first process to second; can be used multiple times
   '&'  should be used only at end of command - backgrounds the command

Notes:
   Ctrl-D or type 'exit' to exit 
   Ctrl-C kills foreground process

Compile simply by doing 'make' in this folder.
